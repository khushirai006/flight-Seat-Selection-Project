# flight-Seat-Selection-Project
This project implements a seat selection system using Apache ECharts and a custom geo/map layout to allow users to choose their seats. 
The system supports both individual and consecutive seat selection with dynamic flag-driven behavior. 
The goal is to provide an intuitive, interactive interface for users while displaying the status of available, reserved, and disabled seats.
